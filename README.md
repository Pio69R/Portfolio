# About Me
My name is Piotr Rydzewski. I have an engineering degree in computer science, specialization: information and facility security. I graduated from Warsaw Management University. Recently I became interested in software testing. My goal is to develop knowledge and technical skills in testing. At the moment, I am gaining experience testing mobile and desktop applications by participating in crowdtesting projects. I am also learning Python which I would like to use for test automation.

Below I present the current skills and knowledge acquired in this field.
